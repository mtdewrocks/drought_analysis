# drought_analysis

The goal of this project was to pull down the latest shapefile from the U.S. Drought Monitor website to ensure the latest shapefile was being used within a Tableau dashboard. The script goes out to the USDM webpage, downloads the shapefile, and extracts it to the necessary folder.
